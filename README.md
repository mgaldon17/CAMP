# Computer Aided Medical Procedures

## Description

This is the repoo for the Computer Aided Medical Procedures course at the Technical University of Munich.
Here there are several scripts that apply different image processing techniques to medical images.

Such imaging techniques include:
- Image segmentation
- Image registration 
- Image classification

## Languages and Tools

This project is built using the following languages and tools:

- C
- C#
- Python

## Installation

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install notebook
```
2. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgaldon17/CAMP.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

4. Jupyter will open in your web browser. Navigate to the .ipynb file you want to run.  

5. You can run the notebook by clicking on the Kernel menu and then Restart & Run All.

Alternatively, you can open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or in IntelliJ IDEA with the Python plugin installed instead of installing Jupyter Notebook.

## Image Filtering


This module contains several Python scripts that perform various image filtering operations.

- `filterinf_frequency_domain.py`: This script performs image filtering in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform.
- `GaussianFilter.py`: This script applies a Gaussian filter to an image.
- `smoothing.py`: This script applies an averaging filter to an image.
- `Plotter.py`: This script contains a class for plotting images and histograms.
- `ImageFiltering.py`: This script loads an image and plots it.
- `HistogramVisualization.py`: This script contains a function for plotting an image and its histogram.
- `HistogramEqualization.py`: This script contains a function for performing histogram equalization on an image.
- `Gaussian_denoising.py`: This script applies various filters to a noisy image and compares the results.
- `Comparision_Gaussian_Bilateral.py`: This script compares the results of applying a Gaussian filter and a bilateral filter to an image.
- `Denoising.py`: This script adds salt and pepper noise to an image.
- `SobelFilter.py`: This script applies the Sobel filter to an image.
- `LaplacianFilter.py`: This script applies the Laplacian filter to an image.

Please refer to the comments in each script for more detailed information about what each script does and how it works.

## Image Transformations

This module contains several Python scripts that perform various image transformation operations. Here's a brief description of each file:

- `Solution_ImageTransformations.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains several image transformation techniques. It includes functions for nearest neighbor splatting, forward warping, inverse warping, and bilinear interpolation. It also includes code to display the transformed images.

Please refer to the comments in each script for more detailed information about what each script does and how it works.

## Intensity-Based Registration

This module contains several Python scripts that perform various intensity-based registration operations. Here's a brief description of each file:

- `Solution_IntensityBasedRegistration.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains several intensity-based registration techniques. It includes functions for mutual information, normalized cross-correlation, and sum of squared differences. It also includes code to display the registered images.

Please refer to the comments in each script for more detailed information about what each script does and how it works.
